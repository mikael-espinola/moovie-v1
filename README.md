# Moovie

Moovie is a personal project application created to practice skills in React.JS, Typescript e API REST.

## Overview

Its main purpose is to help users find movies by providing features such as viewing trailers, accessing reviews, and other pertinent information. With this tool, movie enthusiasts can conveniently explore and discover films, making the process of choosing what to watch easier and more enjoyable.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Find movies: Users can search for movies of their interest using: scroling homepage, by categories and by search name.

- Watch trailers: The application allows users to view movie trailers to get an idea of what to expect.

- Access reviews: Users can check movie reviews and ratings to help make decisions on what to watch.

- Explore relevant information: The application provides pertinent information about the movies, such as cast, director, synopsis, and more.

- Discover new movies: Users can use the application to discover movies they might not have otherwise known about.

- Ease of choice: The application makes it easier for users to decide what to watch, saving time on research.

## My process

### Built with

- React.JS
- Typescript
- Styled-components

### What I learned

- Web Development: Learning how to create a complete web application, combining Styled-Components for styling and Typescript in a React JS application for interactivity and structure.

- Integration of REST API: Understanding how to access and utilize REST APIs to obtain information about movies, such as trailers, reviews, and movie details.

- User Usability: The importance of creating a user-friendly and intuitive user interface to enhance the user experience when exploring and interacting with movies.

- Personal Projects Development: The experience of creating and developing a personal project helps improve problem-solving skills, collaboration, and deepens knowledge in Front-End development.

### Continued development

Next updates:

- Create an account: Users can create their own accounts, allowing for a personalized experience and the ability to save preferences and movie lists.

- Rate movies: Registered users can rate and review movies, contributing to the community's collective feedback and helping others make informed decisions.

- Add movies to favorites: Users can add movies they like to their favorites or watchlist for easy access in the future.

- Personalized recommendations: The application can provide personalized movie recommendations based on a user's past ratings and preferences.

- Create and share lists: Users can create custom movie lists (e.g., favorite movies of all time, must-watch classics) and share them with their friends or the community.

- Discover streaming platforms: The application can provide information on which streaming platforms offer the selected movies, helping users find where they can watch a particular film.

### Useful resources

- [TMBD API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) - This helped me to import movies informations with API REST to create all this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
